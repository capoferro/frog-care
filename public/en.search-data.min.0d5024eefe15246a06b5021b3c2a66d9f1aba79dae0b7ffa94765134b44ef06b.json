The general rule of thumb is \u0026ldquo;no smaller than 10 gallons, and 5 gallons per frog after that\u0026rdquo;. More important than the volume of the vivarium is the amount of navigable surface area in the enclosure. A well set up 18x18x18\u0026quot; (45x45x45cm) vivarium with shelves, branches and plants such as bromiliads that make use of the vertical space is better than a 24x24x24\u0026quot; (60x60x60cm) vivarium that only gives floor space.\nFront opening vs. top opening # Choose front opening when given the choice. It allows for better ventillation so leaf litter and plants can dry out between mistings. Top opening, as in repurposing an aquarium, can work if extra care is taken to ensure good cross-flow ventillation.\nMedium and large frogs (1-2\u0026quot;, 2.5-5cm) # (eg. Dendrobates [tinctorius, leucomela, auratus], Oophaga, Ameerega) Minimum for breeding pair: 18x18x18\u0026quot;, 45x45x45cm\nMore height gives more space for plants and will make species that tend to climb happier. Recommended for 2-3 frogs: 18x18x24\u0026quot;, 45x45x60cm\nSmall frogs (\u0026lt;1\u0026quot;) # (eg. Ranitomeya, Excidobates) Minimum for breeding pair: 12x12x18\u0026quot;, 30x30x45cm\nSources # https://www.thebiodude.com/blogs/reptile-and-amphibian-caresheets-with-cited-veterinary-and-herpetology-sources/keeping-poison-dart-frogs-as-pets-and-bioactive-terrarium-maintenance\n"}]
