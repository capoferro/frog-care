Captive bred frogs do not impact wild ecosystems like capturing wild frogs does, so it is a far more ethical approach to keeping frogs.\nHow much space do you have for a vivarium? # Frogs of different sizes (and climbing preferences) thrive in different size vivariums. See: Vivarium Size.\nHow many frogs do you want to keep in one vivarium? # Frogs of all species can be territorial, more often males than females with a notable exception being D. tinctorius females.

Froglets: 5-7 days a week. Melanogaster or hydei fruit flies depending on frog size Dust flies with calcium + d3 vitamins every feeding, vitamin A at least once a month How to dust flies https://youtu.be/Q9PkDXLK13A?si=azksV1dVeihP2gvj What do I feed? # Frogs eat fruitflies and springtails (which are usually just part of the clean up crew rather than fed directly). These are available in two varieties: melanogaster, a smaller one, and hydei, a larger one. As long as the frogs are big enough to eat them, hydei is the most commonly used fruit fly in the hobby as they have more protein. Melanogaster are needed for smaller frogs and froglets, though larger frogs will happily eat them as well.\nVitamins # Dart frogs must have supplementation for Calcium, Vitamin D3 and Vitamin A. The most common way to give these is by dusting fruit flies before feeding.\nSome supplements, such as Repashy Calcium Plus, contain all of these vitamins in a single owder. Repashy Calcium Plus is considered the \u0026ldquo;Gold Standard\u0026rdquo; of supplements for dart frogs as it is simple and covers all the basics.\nOther supplements, such as Rep-Cal Calcium + D3 do not contain Vitamin A, so, when using these, at least one feeding per month should be dusted with Vitamin A powder instead.\nFrogs can overdose on Vitamin A, so take care not to supplement with it more than once a week when dusting with Vitamin A powder directly.\nWhen breeding, additional Vitamin A is required. Increasing Vitamin A from once a month to 2-4 times per month when actively breeding will help keep frogs healthy. Note that Vitamin A is included in small amounts in All-in-one supplements like Repashy Calcium Plus when increasing Vitamin A supplementation.\nHow to remove fruit flies from cultures, how to dust them and how to feed them to dart frogs How much? # Hard to say, precisely. If there are still a lot of flies left in the enclosure the day of the next feeding, reduce the amount you are feeding a bit. If you can\u0026rsquo;t see any flies, increase the amount you\u0026rsquo;re feeding. If there are a few flies around, you\u0026rsquo;re feeding about the right amount.\nWon\u0026rsquo;t they escape the vivarium and run over my house? # Yeah, probably. You can place a banana slice in the vivarium to give them more reason to stay and you can place apple cider vinager fruit fly traps outside the vivarium to catch flies that do venture out.\nSources # https://www.thebiodude.com/blogs/reptile-and-amphibian-caresheets-with-cited-veterinary-and-herpetology-sources/keeping-poison-dart-frogs-as-pets-and-bioactive-terrarium-maintenance https://joshsfrogs.com/blog/feeding-dart-frogs-often-much https://junglejewelexotics.com/infopages/feed-poison-dart-frog/ "},{"id":2,"href":"/docs/vivarium_size/","title":"Vivarium Size","section":"Docs","content":" Vivarium Size # TL;DR # For 2-3 of most dart frogs, 18x18x24\u0026quot; or 24x18x18\u0026quot;\nMedium and large frogs # (1-2\u0026quot;, 2.5-5cm, eg.

To enable this, ensure there is enough crossflow ventilation in the vivarium.\nMost front-opening vivariums have vents under the doors. Because heat rises, a small amount of cross-flow ventilation will occur as long as there are vents on the lid. This is often not quite enough, however. Placing small USB fans on lid vents to pull air out of the vivarium will draw air in through the front ventilation and out through the fans in the top and dramatically increase this ventilation.\nFor top-opening vivariums, pushing air in one side of the lid and out the other is a common strategy to encourage enough crossflow.\nAs a side bonus, running fans will also ensure that the glass stays clear, making it easier to see inside.\nPopular USB fans: AC Infinity (https://acinfinity.com/quiet-usb-fans/)\nFoot Rot Risk # If the leaf litter stays wet continuously, and frogs have nowhere dry to stand for long periods of time, they are at risk of foot rot which can cause them to lose their toes or feet.

As a result, UVB lights are rarely provided for dart frogs.\nUVB is not trivial to get right and the harm to frogs from misuse is real. Especially for beginners, UVB is not recommended. The risk of overexposure and added setup complexity are not worth the very mild benefits.\nNote that most dart frog vivariums use glass tops to maintain humidity levels. Since glass blocks UVB lighting entirely, the structure of the top of the vivarium will need to change to accomodate a UVB light. Frogs should never be able to be within 6\u0026quot; of a UVB bulb.\nThere is some anecdotal evidence that egg feeder froglets (eg. Oophaga) benefit more from UVB than others are fed by parents directly and do not get supplementation, but there is limited or no scientific data on this.\nDay/Night cycles # At minimum, ensure lights turn on in the morning and off in the evening to keep frogs on a regular day/night cycle. More advanced programmable dimmers allow for progressive brightening to simulate sunrise and sunset which both is less distracting for humans in the room.

Mixing dart frogs carries significant risks, however, so if you want more than one species or locale, only do so if you can keep a separate vivarium for each type.\nProblem 1: Frogs will hybridize when breeding # Many dart frogs are closely related enough that they will hybridize (for example D. tinctorius and D. auratus). Even within a species, there are many distinct locales that are important to keep differentiated in the hobby (for example: D. auratus has morphs including Green and Black, Highland Bronze, Peña Blanca, El Cope and many more).\nIf you have hybridized offspring, you very likely not be able to find homes for the offspring as demand for hybrids is non-existant, so you\u0026rsquo;ll have to keep them. As a result, you will either need to cull the offspring or separate the frogs anyway, to stop them from breeding to avoid being overrun with tadpoles and froglets.\nIf hybridized bloodlines become widespred, it could lead to wild caught smuggling becoming more profitable as they will be the best source of pure bloodlines if hobbyist breeders become lax on mixing frogs.\nProblem 2: Food competition # There is a higher risk of a frog being outcompeted when the frogs are more differentiated\u0026hellip; imagine a Ranitomeya imitator trying to get enough food with a Phyllobates terriblis around.\nI was at [insert Zoo or Aquarium] and they mix frogs! # Zoos and aquariums often mix frogs primarily due to limited display space as they are able to mitigate the problems that arise when mixing frogs.\nThey have full time staff observing and intervening in vivariums when necessary. They are experienced keepers and can make a well informed decision on what frogs should and should not be mixed. Display vivariums, especially mixed display vivariums, are not breeding vivariums, and so any hybridized offspring are not kept. They generally do not participate in the pet trade, so there is less risk of untracked, hybridized bloodlines.

TO THE EXTENT POSSIBLE, IN NO EVENT WILL THE LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, NEGLIGENCE) OR OTHERWISE FOR ANY DIRECT, SPECIAL, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY, OR OTHER LOSSES, COSTS, EXPENSES, OR DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS PUBLIC LICENSE OR USE OF THE LICENSED MATERIAL, EVEN IF THE LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH LOSSES, COSTS, EXPENSES, OR DAMAGES. WHERE A LIMITATION OF LIABILITY IS NOT ALLOWED IN FULL OR IN PART, THIS LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. c. The disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability provided above shall be interpreted in a manner that, to the extent possible, most closely approximates an absolute disclaimer and waiver of all liability. Section 6 -- Term and Termination. a. This Public License applies for the term of the Copyright and Similar Rights licensed here. However, if You fail to comply with this Public License, then Your rights under this Public License terminate automatically. b. Where Your right to use the Licensed Material has terminated under Section 6(a), it reinstates: 1. automatically as of the date the violation is cured, provided it is cured within 30 days of Your discovery of the violation; or 2. upon express reinstatement by the Licensor. For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 6(b) does not affect any right the Licensor may have to seek remedies for Your violations of this Public License. c. For the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also offer the Licensed Material under separate terms or conditions or stop distributing the Licensed Material at any time; however, doing so will not terminate this Public License. d. Sections 1, 5, 6, 7, and 8 survive termination of this Public License. Section 7 -- Other Terms and Conditions. a. The Licensor shall not be bound by any additional or different terms or conditions communicated by You unless expressly agreed. b. Any arrangements, understandings, or agreements regarding the Licensed Material not stated herein are separate from and independent of the terms and conditions of this Public License. Section 8 -- Interpretation. a. For the avoidance of doubt, this Public License does not, and shall not be interpreted to, reduce, limit, restrict, or impose conditions on any use of the Licensed Material that could lawfully be made without permission under this Public License. b. To the extent possible, if any provision of this Public License is deemed unenforceable, it shall be automatically reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable. If the provision cannot be reformed, it shall be severed from this Public License without affecting the enforceability of the remaining terms and conditions. c. No term or condition of this Public License will be waived and no failure to comply consented to unless expressly agreed to by the Licensor. d. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be interpreted as a limitation upon, or waiver of, any privileges and immunities that apply to the Licensor or You, including from the legal processes of any jurisdiction or authority. ======================================================================= Creative Commons is not a party to its public licenses.
