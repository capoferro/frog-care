Look for signs of aggression between frogs and be prepared to separate them if it occurs. Aggression often takes the form of wrestling. Territorial calls from males may be more forced and staccatto.\nVideos of aggressive behavior:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hNMQyy4tJNo https://youtube.com/shorts/PKE1B3VdeCs?si=bLId4HNVBS-DdNw5 Sources\r#\rGonzález-Santoro, Marco \u0026amp; Ph, Jack \u0026amp; Palacios Rodríguez, Pablo.

Most dart frog keepers do not include more than a small, shallow dish of water for their frogs.\nProblem 1: Frogs can drown\r#\rFrog aggression can occur in any species, not just D. tinctorius females. When wrestling, frogs that otherwise do swim reasonably well, may drown if the water is more than half their height. Outside of aggression, if frogs are sick or otherwise weak, they are also at greater risk of drowning.\nSee: Aggression\nProblem 2: Water must be kept clean\r#\rWater in a vivarium is prone to being stagnant, which means dead flies, frog poop and whatever else can make the water dangerous for your frogs. The water must be kept clean at all times either via a well maintained filter system or by replacing the water frequently. Water features are high maintenance. Water in the water feature needs to be kept separate from the drainage layer to make sure it stays free of excess tanins, bacteria and whatever else has collected in the drainage layer.\nSources:\r#\rhttps://ncdartfrogs.com/blogs/tutorials-information/building-the-large-vivarium "},{"id":3,"href":"/docs/feeding/","title":"Feeding","section":"Docs","content":"\rFeeding Dart Frogs\r#\rTL;DR:\nFrogs: 3 days a week. Froglets: 5-7 days a week. Melanogaster or hydei fruit flies depending on frog size Dust flies with calcium + d3 vitamins every feeding, vitamin A at least once a month Howto: https://youtu.be/Q9PkDXLK13A?si=azksV1dVeihP2gvj What do I feed?\r#\rFrogs eat fruitflies and springtails (which are usually just part of the clean up crew rather than fed directly). These are available in two varieties: melanogaster, a smaller one, and hydei, a larger one. As long as the frogs are big enough to eat them, hydei is the most commonly used fruit fly in the hobby as they have more protein. Melanogaster are needed for smaller frogs and froglets, though larger frogs will happily eat them as well.\nVitamins\r#\rDart frogs must have supplementation for Calcium, Vitamin D3 and Vitamin A. The most common way to give these is by dusting fruit flies before feeding. Some supplements, such as Repashy Calcium Plus, contain all of these vitamins in a single powder. Other supplements, such as Rep-Cal Calcium + D3 do not contain Vitamin A, so, when using these, at least one feeding per month should be dusted with Vitamin A powder instead.\nHow to remove fruit flies from cultures, how to dust them and how to feed them to dart frogs How much?\r#\rHard to say, precisely. If there are still a lot of flies left in the enclosure the day of the next feeding, reduce the amount you are feeding a bit. If you can\u0026rsquo;t see any flies, increase the amount you\u0026rsquo;re feeding. If there are a few flies around, you\u0026rsquo;re feeding about the right amount.\nWon\u0026rsquo;t they escape the vivarium and run over my house?\r#\rYeah, probably. You can place a banana slice in the vivarium to give them more reason to stay and you can place apple cider vinager fruit fly traps outside the vivarium to catch flies that do venture out.\nSources\r#\rhttps://www.thebiodude.com/blogs/reptile-and-amphibian-caresheets-with-cited-veterinary-and-herpetology-sources/keeping-poison-dart-frogs-as-pets-and-bioactive-terrarium-maintenance https://joshsfrogs.com/blog/feeding-dart-frogs-often-much https://junglejewelexotics.com/infopages/feed-poison-dart-frog/ "},{"id":4,"href":"/docs/vivarium_size/","title":"Vivarium Size","section":"Docs","content":"\rVivarium Size\r#\rTL;DR: For most dart frogs, 18x18x24\u0026quot; for 2-3 frogs.
