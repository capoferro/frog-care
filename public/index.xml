      <description>Choosing Frogs # TL;DR # Excellent beginner frogs:&#xA;Dendrobates leucomela Dendrobates tinctorius Dendrobates auratus Epipedobates anthonyi What looks the coolest? # Browse lots of great frog pictures here: http://www.dendrowiki.org/alle.html&#xA;How much space do you have for a vivarium? # Frogs of different sizes (and climbing preferences) thrive in different size vivariums. See: Vivarium Size.&#xA;How many frogs do you want to keep in one vivarium? # Frogs of all species can be territorial, more often males than females with a notable exception being D.</description>

      <description>Feeding Dart Frogs # TL;DR:&#xA;Frogs: 3 days a week. Froglets: 5-7 days a week. Melanogaster or hydei fruit flies depending on frog size Dust flies with calcium + d3 vitamins every feeding, vitamin A at least once a month Howto: https://youtu.be/Q9PkDXLK13A?si=azksV1dVeihP2gvj What do I feed? # Frogs eat fruitflies and springtails (which are usually just part of the clean up crew rather than fed directly). These are available in two varieties: melanogaster, a smaller one, and hydei, a larger one.</description>

      <description>Vivarium Size # TL;DR # For 2-3 of most dart frogs, 18x18x24&amp;quot;.&#xA;Medium and large frogs # (1-2&amp;quot;, 2.5-5cm, eg. Dendrobates [tinctorius, leucomela, auratus], Oophaga, large Ameerega such as bassleri)&#xA;2-3 frogs: 18x18x18&amp;quot;, 45x45x45cm 2-3 arboreal frogs: 18x18x24&amp;quot;, 45x45x60cm. Even &amp;ldquo;terrestrial frogs&amp;rdquo; such as D. tinctorius and D. leucomelas are known to climb all available space in a 24&amp;quot; tall vivarium and will be happy to have it. Small frogs # (&amp;lt;1&amp;quot;, eg.</description>

      <description>Aggression / Territoriality # TL;DR # Aggression can occur in any species of dart frogs. Look for signs of aggression between frogs and be prepared to separate them if it occurs. Aggression often takes the form of wrestling with territorial calls from males being forced and staccatto than mating calls.&#xA;Do well in groups # Dendrobates auratus Dendrobates leucomela Epipedobates anthonyi Phyllobates (all species) Ranitomeya (all species) Ameerega (all species) Do not do well in groups # Dendrobates tinctorius females are territorial, limit groups to breeding pair or two males, one female Oophaga (all species) males are territorial, small groups can be ok but do best in breeding pairs Videos of aggressive behavior # https://www.</description>

      <description>Water Features # ##TL;DR&#xA;Don&amp;rsquo;t include a water feature unless you know exactly what you&amp;rsquo;re doing, which probably means you don&amp;rsquo;t need this information.&#xA;Water features are complicated, prone to problems and take away from much needed surface area in an already constrained space and are generally more complicated and risky than the aesthetics make them worth. Most dart frog keepers do not include more than a small, shallow dish of water for their frogs to soak in (sometimes with a calcium clay mixture).</description>
