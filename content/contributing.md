## Advanced page editing

Frog.care is built with a site generator called Hugo, so all Hugo template tags work. This is advanced stuff, though, so don't worry about it unless you're feeling fancy. You won't likely need much or any of Hugo's functionality to edit content. If you are feeling fancy, here's a reference: https://gohugo.io/documentation/

The site's theme is Hugo Book. Reference: https://themes.gohugo.io/themes/hugo-book/
