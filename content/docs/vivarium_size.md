# Vivarium Size

**TL;DR: For most dart frogs, 18x18x24" for 2-3 frogs. Check your species for aggression tendencies.**

## Medium and large frogs
*(1-2", 2.5-5cm, eg. Dendrobates [tinctorius, leucomela, auratus], Oophaga, Ameerega)*  
* **Minimum (2-3 frogs):** 18x18x18", 45x45x45cm
* **Recommended (2-3 frogs):** 18x18x24", 45x45x60cm. Even "terrestrial frogs" such as D. tinctorius and D. leucomelas and A. bassleri are known to climb all available space in a 24" tall vivarium and will be happy to have it.
## Small frogs
*(<1", eg. Ranitomeya, Excidobates)*  
* **Minimum (2 frogs):** 12x12x18", 30x30x45cm
* Small dart frogs, such as Ranitomeya, are generally arboreal and will appreciate all the climbing space you can give them. Taller is better.

## Rule of thumb
People often say "5-10 gallons per frog". Speaking in terms of "gallons" is a bit misleading, however, as what really matters is surface area from shelves, branches and plants for frogs to traverse and cover for them to hide. Lots of surface area and cover in a smaller vivarium is better than a bigger vivarium that is mostly flat.

A well set up 18x18x18" (45x45x45cm) vivarium with shelves, branches and plants such as bromiliads that make use of the vertical space is better than a 24x24x24" (60x60x60cm) vivarium that only gives floor space. 

Hobbyists on forums will alway say "bigger is better". While they're correct, extremely large vivariums are not always practical. 

## Aggression
The smaller the vivarium, the higher the probability of aggression. See: [Aggression](< relref "/docs/aggression.md">)

## Front opening vs. top opening

Choose front opening when given the choice. It allows for better ventillation so leaf litter and plants can dry out between mistings. Top opening, as in repurposing an aquarium, can work if extra care is taken to ensure good cross-flow ventillation.
