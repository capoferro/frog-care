# Choosing Frogs

## What looks the coolest?

Browse lots of great frog pictures here: http://www.dendrowiki.org/alle.html

## How much space do you have for a vivarium?

Frogs of different sizes (and climbing preferences) thrive in different size vivariums. See: [Vivarium Size]({{<relref "vivarium_size.md">}}).

## How many frogs do you want to keep in one vivarium?

Frogs of all species can be territorial, more often males than females with a notable exception being D. tinctorius females. See [Aggression]({{<relref "aggression.md">}}) for a list of frogs that are known to do well in groups.

See also [Vivarium Size]({{<relref "vivarium_size.md">}}).

## How noise sensitive are you?

Dart frogs have wildly different calls, which might affect whether they will annoy you in your house. Dart frogs are diurnal, so they don't call during the night with most of their activity being during the day. 7am through 7pm are relatively normal calling hours. They mostly call in the mornings and evenings.

Dendrowiki also has sound recordings of many frogs: http://www.dendrowiki.org/alle.html

## Boldness

Broadly speaking, the bigger the frog, the bolder it is. The safer the vivarium feels for the frogs, with plenty of hides and areas shaded from bright grow lights, the bolder frogs will be.

### Bold frogs

* Dendrobates tinctorius
* Dendrobates leucomela
* Phyllobates terriblis

### Moderately bold frogs

* Ameerega
* Dendrobates auratus

### Shy frogs
