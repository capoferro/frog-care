# Temperature

## TL;DR

Most dart frogs thrive at 70&deg;F (21&deg;C). They can tolerate up to 80&deg;F (26&deg;C) and down to 65&deg;F (18&deg;C) for short periods of time. 85&deg;F (29&deg;C) and above is potentially fatal.

## Heat the Room

The best way to manage vivarium temperatures is by heating the room. If you absolutely can't heat the room with space heaters or other ambient solutions, a heating mat linked with a thermostat can work. Avoid heat lamps as they will dry out the vivarium and potentially damage the frogs' skin.
